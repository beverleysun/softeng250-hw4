## Various processing of directed graphs

```
Given input directed graph, G, the code should do the following:
1.  Output all the vertices that have the same in and out degrees.
2.  Output the average in-degree and the average out-degree of vertices.
3.  Test if G has a cycle.
4.  If G has a cycle you code should output at least one cycle.
5.  Test if G has at most 3 cycles.
6.  If the G has no cycles, then your code should output topological ordering of G.
```
